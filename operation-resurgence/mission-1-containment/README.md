# Mission 1 - Containment

## Brief

> Two days ago we started getting a distress call on a loop from someone claiming to be a UAC operative at a facility in the Valles Marineris. Let me be clear, this facility does not exist. We're sending you in there to confirm this fact and silence this erroneous message. Should you encounter any personnel on site, they should be secured and brought back for questioning. We need to know who is trying to torpedo the UAC's efforts to recover its scientific pursuits on Mars, and silence this espionage before it gets into the hands of the UN.

## Objectives

- Destroy or disable the communication
- Detain any site personnel

## Layout - not known by the marines

## 1. Airlock Control

The marines start in the airlock marked S. The airlock control room (1) is visible to them despite the closed door.

### Before entry

> The concealed door outside bore no UAC markings but through the clouded port on the inner door you see what looks to be a familiar corporation airlock control room. The lights are out but something seems to be shuffling around in there

### On entry

Place a Possessed Soldier and Marine Charlie in spots marked A and B. Place one demon initiative randomly in the remaining initiative deck.

> As the inner door opens the emergency strip lights flicker on. On one side of the room a lump of twisted bleeding flesh and metal begins to stir despite its injuries. On the other a man in a full VAC suit presumably heading for the airlock, wields a blood spattered chainsaw, presumably what did the injuring. He waives it erratically but his shouts are reduced to mumbles by his helmet.

Marine charlie is actually also a semi-Possessed Soldier. He will attack the marines given the chance. When defeated he drops the chainsaw weapon token and regains his humanity:

> As his red eyes fade humanity returns to the mans face. He speaks more calmly now and explains, "The facility studies long range teleportation. We had broken through; teleported living creatures hundreds of miles and back. But as soon as the first human went through 'creatures' started coming back. It warped peoples minds, changed their bodies, turned them crazy. We tried to sever the power but the command centre clearly has backup generators we weren't told about. The route to the command centre is left through the lab. The armoury has service duct access but its dangerous and he's pretty sure the creatures have been using the ducts to get around. Don't whatever you do open the teleporter doors.

## 2. Annex

> Ahead is a sign marked _Auxillary Translocation Pod_ with a defaced door. To the left a sign marked _Laboratory_ and to the right _Armoury_.

## 3. Auxillary Translocation Pod

Place one Pinky and one Cacodemon adding initiative cards if necessary.

> A flash of glowing red light fills your retinas. When they finally recover two glowing embers remain. Two burning eyes in a snarling skull that lunges towards you. Above it floats something much, much worse.

## 4. Laboratory Holding Pens

Place 4 Possessed Soldiers in squares adjacent to A.

> In the back corner the pens that used to hold the teleportation test subjects now brim with the same twisted beasts as the one you found in airlock control. It appears they are ex-personnel, some still wearing lab coats and ID cards over their twisted modifications. Just as you thank your luck that the containment field is on the backup generators something bursts out of a vent above and the rubble destroys the power relay.

The first Marine in the room suffers 3 damage from falling rubble. Place two Imps in any location in the room.

## 5. Armoury

> The Armoury is a dead end apart from a smallish service duct funnelling in the sound of a faulty air circulator. Along the walls are rows of empty gun racks. Either this facility is severely under-stocked or somebody went full Rambo in here. A med-pack, a pack of grenades and a solitary static rifle remain. The door lets out a worrying groan as it shuts behind you, but more worrying is that "faulty fan" noise seems to be getting closer.

Close the door. Place the static rifle, grenade and med pack. The Marine player can choose to swap a weapon for the static rifle. The demon player can now choose whether or not the armoury door opens when a player attempts to use it. If not it still costs a movement point.

## 6. Service Ducts

> The duct crackles with electricity. Clearly, the backup power system was installed hastily and against UAC procedures. Whilst the flashes occasionally light the way, one wrong move is going to result in a nasty jolt. Whats more, you start to think you're not the only one in here...

Once per marine and per entry to the ducts the demon player decides if and when the following happen:

- Two Imps appear in the ducts
- The Marine player becomes stunned by electric
