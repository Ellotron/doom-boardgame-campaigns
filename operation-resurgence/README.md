# Doom Operation: Resurgence

An alternative operation for Doom the board game (2016) following a campaign style story to be played in sequence. It is intended for two marine players.

## Background

> After the Lazarus incident in UAC facilities on Mars all research into argent energy was banned. Though it was rumoured that other top secret facilities continued their research, nothing was ever proven. The UAC denied all such accusations citing the now continued UN presence on Mars who had found no such facilities despite constant monitoring. But some believed that the inherent secrecy of the corporation may have hidden some operations even from itself. Lost within the myriad of denials and fronts of above-board science, deep within uncharted martian territory, many feared that progress was still being recklessly pursued by the few. When a UAC outpost intercepted an SOS from what should have been an empty sector of the Valles Marineris, those fears became suddenly very real.

## Gameplay

The game is played out using the 2016 Doom board game components and base rules. Some rule additions are alterations apply discussed below and/or specifically within each mission.

### Rules - additions and alterations

- Generally the demon player reads quote sections (such as the background above) to the marine players as appropriate.

- The maps should not be revealed to the marines ahead of the game. Unless the obtain explicit intel in the mission brief all items, power ups and the layout itself should only be placed when a marine first gains line of sight to it.

- Unless otherwise stated marines that die respawn the next round in the place they were at the start of the round. Use the teleporter token to make this position at the start of each round.

- The spaces marked `?` contain anything the demon player chooses (that will fit). If the Marines are doing too well add some demons, if they're in bad shape add weapons or med packs.
